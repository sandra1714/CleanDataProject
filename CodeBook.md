Below are the features selected for the tidy database. They are the means and standard deviations of signals obtained from: the accelerometer and gyroscope 
3-axial raw signals and the Fast Fourier Transforms of a few of these signals. The signals are obtained from the sensor during the subject motion.
Note that the acceleration signal was only that of the body as it was separated from the gravity acceleration signal.

Note that all features are normalized and bounded within [-1,1].	

Also note that all the transformations and scripts run to clean up the data and to arrive to this dataset are described in both README.md and run_analysis.R.
